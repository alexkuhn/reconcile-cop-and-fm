# Purpose

A Context-Oriented Framework in Ruby to easily build Context-Aware Applications.
It reconciles ideas from both *Context-Oriented Programming* (COP) and *Feature-Oriented Software Development* (FOSD). In particular, it uses the implementation technology of COP, and extends it with Feature Modeling.

This repository is the subject of a Master Thesis at Catholic University of Louvain (UCL), Belgium.
